<h1> Hi I'm Mauz!</h1>
<p><IMG SRC=mauz.jpg"></p>

<p1> My family got me at the Augusta Humane Society. She said that I was the first cat that they brought out. I love living with my family. The best think about being a cat is that I don't have to really listen to anyone. I love spending time outside in the woods.</p1>

<p>My favorite thing to do is kill things. My mom doesn't really like it when I bring the animals into the house but it's okay because I eat them. I love it when my faverite owner comes home from college because we play outside together all year long. When I was little she and I would play hide and seek around the house. Everytime I found her I would get a small treat.</p>

<p>I have a couple siblings. One is a cat and the other is a dog. I used to have two dog sibling but one isn't with us anymore. His name is Buddy and he was my faverite.
