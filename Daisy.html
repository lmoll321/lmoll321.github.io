<h1> Hi My name is Daisy</h1>

<P>I Love to snuggle with everyone!</p>
<p>It's an interesting storty of how I came to love with this family. I am actually the girlfriends dog that was supposed to leave a long time ago. This family still loves me as if I was their own. When I was living at my previous home I had to be on anti-anxiety medication and I would go after anything that wasn't a dog or a cow. I would go after cats, turkies, groundhogs, and the like.</p>
<p> Now, however, I don't take any medications and I don't go after most things now. just the occasional groundhod and mise. No more turkies and cats. It tool a whole for me to adjust to this family because my (previous) owner used me as an ewmtional crutch. My new mom told me that if I continue to go after the cats I wouldn't be able to stay at this house. Now I live a very stress free life and I wouldn't want it any other way. 
<p> My faverite things to do are to run in the pasture and to get attention from everyone. In the morning I wait right next to my mom's bed for her to get up so that she can feed me. No matter how hard my family tries I still hate riding in cars though.
