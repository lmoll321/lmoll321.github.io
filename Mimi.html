<h1> My name is Mimi</h1>

<p>I an the oldest pet that the family has. Originally I was the oldest daughters pet but now I an my mom's faverite animal. I sleep by her side every night. My mom has to keep her bedroom door closed because there was a time when I was having stomach problems. To my mom's dismay my faverite place to puke was on the windowsill in her room. There was a time when I only lived with two other cats. One was named Cuddles and the other was Motorcycle. But after a while those guys got ran over by cars. then it was time to get a dog.
