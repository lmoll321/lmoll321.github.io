<h1>Welcome To The History of All My Family's Pets</h1>
</head>
<p>Ever since I was small I have always been around animals. Horses, cats, dogs, fish, and even chickens and turkies! Raising turkies was certainly an interesting experiance. Thankfully one that will not be repeated. The first pet that I can ever remember having was my mom's blue heeler when we were living in Montana. When we came back to our home in New England my grandfather had a couple hourses in his pasture. One was named Karess and the other David. Karess eventually got pregnant and that is how Brownie came to be. We called him brownie because he was as dark as a frest batch of brownies.</p>
<p>My grandmother also had her fair share of pets. Only cats though. There was Amis, Tuffy, and Fluffy. Amis was an all black cat Sadly he was gone all too soon and that was when she got Tuffy and Fluffy. Tuffy was a brown tappy cat and Fluffy was an all white cat. They were originally ment to be mine and my sister's cats.
